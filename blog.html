                    <h2>our certificate & online program for 2023</h2>
                    <p>A modern language degree is not just about learning a new language – 
                        though of course attaining a high level of fluency is one of the goals. 
                        Many programs will require students to study courses which develop their 
                        understanding of past and present cultures relating to the 
                        country (or countries) in which the language of study is spoken. 
                        This learning often requires the study of literary texts, film and media, 
                        as well as learning about the historical and political contexts of a certain region. 
                        Professionally focused courses may also be available, covering topics such as translation, 
                        international relations, business processes in different regions, or media and 
                        communication studies.</p>

                        <p>It’s possible to study modern languages either as a single honors 
                            degree or alongside another subject as a joint honors degree. 
                            Common joint honors choices often remain within the humanities, 
                            including subjects such as politics, history and literature, 
                            but modern languages can also be combined with subjects such as 
                            chemistry or mathematics, for those wishing to keep their options 
                            as broad as possible. Another option is to study two languages, 
                            such as Arabic and And Spanish.</p>

                            <p>One of the main attractions of a modern language degree is the 
                                opportunity to spend either a semester or a year abroad in a 
                                country where the language of study is widely spoken. 
                                This experience aims to increase proficiency in the language of 
                                study, while also allowing students to immerse themselves in 
                                another culture and meet the challenge of communicating with a
                                broad range of people. For this reason, many modern language 
                                programs are four years in length, with one year 
                                (often the third year) spent in a partnered institution abroad,
                                either working or studying.</p>
